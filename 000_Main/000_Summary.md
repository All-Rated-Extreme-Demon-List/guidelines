## Summary {:guideline-summary}

While we advise you to read the guidelines in full, here are the main things you should keep in mind:

# 

* Your completion video and raw footage must have all clicks fully audible throughout the entire completion.
* You must record and [upload](#public-video-uploading) a video of your completion to YouTube or another video sharing platform.
* Completion videos may not be deleted after they are accepted.
* If your video was uploaded after July 2nd, 2023, your [record must have all cheat indicators](#cheat-indicators) visible on the level's end screen.
* Your record must show the [stats on the endscreen](#level-stats) (attempts, orbs, etc.).
* If your record is in the top 400, you must have [raw footage](#raw-footage), with isolated clicks, uploaded in a downloadable format (e.g. Google Drive) and submitted along with your public video.
* Your record may not use any [disallowed mods](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1M4vXMxHcYwtstB6SD9r4lPFotUXhz3IL9D_3JX8tjyE).
* If you are using a [custom copy](#custom-copies) of a level, it must either be approved by list staff, or not significantly affect the level's gameplay or difficulty without a doubt.
* During your completion, you may not use any [skips](#skips) that make any section of the level significantly easier.
* Globed [2P Completions](#two-player) are allowed, however, you need to include both POVs in the video or provide a link to watch the other POV, and the completion must be on [an approved Globed 2P copy](#custom-copies).

Note that some of these guidelines may be waived if your record is older than a certain date, which you can read more about below.
