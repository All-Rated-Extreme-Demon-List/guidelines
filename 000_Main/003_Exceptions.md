Some rules can be bypassed if a completion is confirmed to be older than a certain date. The date of the completion is determined by the upload date of the video, however if you have irrefutable evidence that suggests otherwise, you can mention that in your recordâ€™s Additional Notes. [TODO: explain what kind of proof can be provided]
