## Loopholes

Players may not exploit any loopholes these guidelines may have. If a loophole is used to avoid breaking a rule, the record will be treated the same way as if that rule was broken.

List staff will constitute what counts as a loophole on a case by case basis, based on factors such as whether using the loophole results in the same advantage as breaking a specifically declared rule.
