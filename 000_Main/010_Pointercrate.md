## Pointercrate {:pointercrate-auto-accept}

Some guidelines listed here can be waived if the record you are submitting is already on [the Pointercrate Demonlist](https://pointercrate.com/), which only ranks the top 150 extreme demons. The guidelines this applies to are:

* [Clicks](#clicks)
* [Cheat Indicators](#cheat-indicators)
* [Level Stats](#level-stats)
* [Raw footage](#raw-footage)

However, if Physics Bypass was used in your completion, your record will still be denied even if it is on Pointercrate. This is because Physics Bypass was allowed for a short period on Pointercrate, but was never allowed on the AREDL.
Please note that this exception only applies to Pointercrate, records on any other list are ineligible for this exception. 

We _highly_ recommend mentioning in your Additional Notes if your record has already been accepted on Pointercrate, along with your player name or a link to your Stats Viewer profile.
