# AREDL Guidelines {:home}

Welcome to the AREDL Guidelines! This page provides an in-depth explanation of everything you need to know before you submit records to the AREDL. These guidelines are in place to help the list team confirm your legitimacy in your records, and to ensure a safe and fair experience to the community.

While these guidelines are used by the list team to determine whether a record will be accepted or denied, and hope to be as accurate and detailed as possible, records can still be denied even if they do not break any rules listed here. However, if you believe your record has been wrongfully rejected, please resubmit it and explain in the additional notes why you think so.

This pageâ€™s content is available in markdown format on GitHub \[TODO: insert link\], so if you notice any errors or badly worded sections, feel free to open a pull request.
