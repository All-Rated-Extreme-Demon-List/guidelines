## Removing clicks

You are allowed to edit out your microphone audio from your public video, as long as you **submit a video with the unedited audio under the “Raw Footage” section** in the record submitter. In this scenario, both videos need to follow the “Deleting Videos” rule, meaning both videos need to remain accessible to the list team. \[TODO: add link\] If your record is top 400 and requires raw footage, you may remove the clicks from the public video and submit your raw footage where they are audible. You are allowed to delete your raw following the reviewal of your record, so we recommend you also upload a permanently accessible video with clicks and attach it to the Additional Notes. This is because if the list team is ever suspicious of your record after it is accepted, and it doesn't provide a way to listen to the clicks, it will be removed. Please do not assume your record will never be suspicious, as we could be looking into your records for a number of reasons which may be confidential outside of the list team.
