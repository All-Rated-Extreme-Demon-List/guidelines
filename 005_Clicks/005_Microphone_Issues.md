## Microphone Issues

If your microphone has any sort of built-in noise cancellation, a noise gate, or other feature that could remove background noise or quiet sounds, or otherwise fails to consistently capture your click sounds, please double-check that your clicks remain audible with that feature in use. If said feature causes your clicks to become very quiet, or they are mostly audible but some get cut off, your record can be denied. To combat this, you can try disabling this feature entirely, moving your microphone closer to your input device, or recording your clicks with a separate device, like a phone. If you use a phone to record clicks, please mention as such in the Additional Notes, along with a link to download the recording.
