# Clicks
Your completion video or raw footage must have clicks **fully audible** throughout the **entire** completion. There are very little exceptions to this rule, as hearing the clicks in a completion is an integral part of the record reviewal process. **Every click in the your completion must be clearly heard in the audio.**

## Date exception
If your completion took place before after *August 25th 2020*, your record is exempt from this rule. 
## Removing clicks
You are allowed to edit out your microphone audio from your public video, as long as you **submit a video with the unedited audio under the “Raw Footage” section** in the record submitter. In this scenario, both videos need to follow the “Deleting Videos” rule, meaning both videos need to remain accessible to the list team. 

## Non-alternatives
There are some misconceptions regarding alternatives to having audible clicks. Clickbots (mods that produce artificial click sounds, e.g. Click Sounds, ZCB Live, any clickbot built into a macro software), CPS Counters, and the Inputs Viewer mod are **not** substitutes for having audible clicks, as they can be influenced by third-party tools. Note that the use of clickbots is banned in records altogether, even if your completion also has real clicks.
