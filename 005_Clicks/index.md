# Clicks

**Your completion video or raw footage must have clicks fully audible throughout the entire completion.** There are very little exceptions to this rule, as hearing the clicks in a completion is an integral part of the record reviewal process. It is possible for your record to be denied if your clicks are very quiet but still technically audible, as it can be very hard for the list team to distinguish them from the level's song. To reiterate, **every click in the your completion must be clearly heard in the audio.**

## Date exception

If your completion is dated before *August 25th 2020*, your record is exempt from this rule. Please read more information about exceptions to our guidelines here. \[TODO: add link\]
