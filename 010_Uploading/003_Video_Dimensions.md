# Video Dimensions {:video-dimensions}
Your completion video and raw footage must be recorded **horizontally**. Vertical videos (e.g. TikTok videos, YouTube Shorts) are not allowed **unless you also provide a horizontal video when you submit**. For levels not in the top 400, this can simply be an unlisted YouTube video of your completion, which should also follow all of our guidelines. Furthermore, you may not upload and submit your completion video to a platform that forces it into a vertical aspect ratio (e.g. TikTok, Instagram Reels), unless you provide complementary footage which can be viewed in a horizontal orientation (Ex: Unlisted YouTube video, or Google Drive raw footage link).

## Exceptions {:video-dimensions-exceptions}
- Liveplays (videos recorded using an external camera, like a cell phone) are exempt from this rule. You can read more about liveplays [here](#liveplays).
