## Video Dimensions {:video-dimensions}
Records that have been digitally recorded and submitted in a vertical orientation are not allowed for submission, unless complementary footage, which is horizontally oriented, is provided in the raw footage section of the record submissions page. This applies to records submitted using video platforms, such as TikTok, YouTube Shorts, and Instagram Reels. In addition, you may not submit a horizontally oriented video to a video platform which forces it into vertical aspect ratio, unless you provide an additional video with the aforementioned raw footage restrictions.
