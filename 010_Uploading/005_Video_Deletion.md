## Video Deletion {:public-video-deletion}

**Completion videos may not be deleted after they are accepted.**Â You may unlist the video on YouTube, but the list staff must be able to rewatch the video at any time if needed. Records with deleted videos are subject to removal. Note that you are allowed to delete your raw footage, but not the public video attached to your record.
