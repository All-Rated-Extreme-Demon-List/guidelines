## Vulgar content

**Videos with extremely vulgar or otherwise offensive content or audio can be denied.** The list team will decide on a case by case basis what constitutes as “vulgar or offensive content or audio”. 
Examples of this include but are not limited to hate speech, repetition of slurs, or anything offensive and/or in violation of the platform your video is hosted on.
If your video unintentionally breaks this rule (e.g. someone in a voice call says something during the winning attempt), you may edit the video to remove said content. However, if the edited video then breaks another one of our guidelines (e.g. removing the audio makes the clicks inaudible, covering up a part of the screen), you must submit the unedited video as your raw footage.
