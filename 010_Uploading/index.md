# Uploading {:public-video-uploading}

**Your completion video must be uploaded to YouTube or another video sharing platform.**Â Other examples of video sharing platforms include Twitch and Vimeo, but services like Google Drive (File sharing), and Facebook or X (Non-video focused social media platforms) are not allowed for your public completion video.

Note that you must use a file-sharing platform to upload and submit your **raw footage,** like Google Drive. You may not upload your raw footage to YouTube for example, as it compresses and alters the video file, and does not allow the list team to directly download it. You can read more about raw footage here. \[TODO: add link\]
