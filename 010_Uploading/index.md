# Uploading {:public-video-uploading}

**Before submitting a record, you must record and upload a video of your completion to YouTube or another video sharing platform.** The content and gameplay in this video must follow all of our guidelines. We recommend you use OBS to record your microphone, audio, and the entire game window. Other examples of video sharing platforms include Twitch and Vimeo, but services like Google Drive (File sharing), and Facebook or X (Non-video focused social media platforms) are not allowed for your public completion video.

Note that raw footage, if required, follows a different set of rules than your publicly accessible video. You may **not** upload your raw footage to YouTube. You can read more about raw footage [here](#raw-footage).

If you use a webcam, please make sure it does not cover or obscure parts of your game (e.g. cheat indicators, the icon and/or main gameplay, the CBF watermark, etc).
