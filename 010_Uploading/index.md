# Uploading {:public-video-uploading}

**Before submitting a record, you must record and upload a video of your completion [a supported video-sharing platform](#completion-link-platforms).** The content and gameplay in this video must follow all of our guidelines. We recommend you use OBS to record your microphone, audio, and the entire game window.

Note that raw footage, if required, follows a different set of rules than your publicly accessible video. You may **not** upload your raw footage to YouTube. You can read more about raw footage [here](#raw-footage).

If you use a webcam, please make sure it does not cover or obscure parts of your game (e.g. cheat indicators, the icon and/or main gameplay, the CBF watermark in the top-right corner, etc).

### Invisible Level Requirements

For levels that have primarily invisible gameplay such as of Ambrosia or M A N I X, players are required to submit [raw footage](#raw-footage) along with [liveplay footage](#liveplays) of their monitor.
