# Uploading {:public-video-uploading}

**Your completion video must be uploaded to YouTube or another video sharing platform.**Â Other examples of video sharing platforms include Twitch and Vimeo, but services like Google Drive (File sharing), and Facebook or X (Non-video focused social media platforms) are not allowed for your public completion video.

Note that raw footage, if required, follows a different set of rules than your publicly accessible video. You may **not** upload your raw footage to YouTube. You can read more about raw footage [here](#raw-footage).
