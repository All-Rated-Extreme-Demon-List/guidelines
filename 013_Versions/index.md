# Versions {:gd-versions}

If you are playing on a version of Geometry Dash that is not the latest version, you must follow the guidelines for records of that version. For records which took place on a version before 2.2, this means the FPS counter must be visible, and your framerate must not be set above 360 FPS. This applies for completions using both native refresh rate or using any bypass of FPS or TPS.

## GDPSs {:gdps-versions}

If you are playing on a private server (GDPS), your record will be treated as if it was played on the GD version the GDPS is based on. For example, 2.1 GDPSs must follow 2.1 rules (FPS counter must be shown, FPS/TPS should be at or lower than 360)
