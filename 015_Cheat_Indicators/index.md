# Cheat Indicators {:cheat-indicators}

**If your record uses a hack or mod with an endscreen cheat indicator, that cheat indicator must be clearly visible and indicate that no cheats were used in your completion.** Note that our use of the term “endscreen cheat indicator” is referring specifically to any cheat indicator placed in the dropdown endscreen window that appears upon the completion of a level. This does not include a cheat indicator visible throughout the entire level, even if it indicates no cheats while the endscreen is visible.

## Exceptions {:exceptions}

Due to the relatively recent growth of Geometry Dash modding and the optionality of external mods, there are a few exceptions to this rule. These exceptions are prioritized in the order they are listed, meaning if two exceptions conflict with eachother, the one listed higher will take priority and override the one listed lower:

* Your record does not need to follow this rule if it has been accepted on Pointercrate. You can read more about records already accepted on Pointercrate here. \[TODO: add link\]
* If your completion took place before July 2nd, 2023, any **mod menus** used in your completion are not required to have the cheat indicator visible. We classify a “mod menu” as any external mod or hack that provides a collection of toggle-able hacks and changes to the game. Common examples include [Mega Hack](https://absolllute.com/store/mega_hack), [QOLMod](https://geode-sdk.org/mods/thesillydoggo.qolmod), [Eclipse](https://geode-sdk.org/mods/eclipse.eclipse-menu), and [Prism Menu](https://geode-sdk.org/mods/firee.prism).
* If the hack or mod used in your completion does not have an endscreen cheat indicator but does have an in-level cheat indicator, **the in-level cheat indicator is required to be clearly visible throughout your completion.**
* If your completion uses a mod or hack that has a cheat indicator, but took place **before said cheat indicator was added to the mod**, the requirement of that cheat indicator will be waived for your completion.
* If you do not use a mod or hack that has a cheat indicator, your record is exempt from this rule.

## Indicator Types {:cheat-indicator-types}

As previously stated, your cheat indicator must indicate a legitimate completion. In Mega Hack, the most popular mod menu in Geometry Dash, both dots on the top left of the endscreen window should be green. If either dot is any color but green, including the yellow dot due to safe mode being on, your record will be denied. You can read more about Safe Mode and which Mega Hack cheats are allowed for use in records here. \[TODO: add link\]
