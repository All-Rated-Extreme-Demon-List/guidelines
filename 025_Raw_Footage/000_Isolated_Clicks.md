## Isolated clicks {:isolated-clicks}

Your microphone audio (more specifically, your click sounds) must be on a **separated and isolated audio track** in your raw footage file. This means that one of the audio tracks must record your microphone audio, and **only** your microphone audio. Here are some guides explaining how to configure this with some popular recording softwares:

If you use a different software, you can try googling “\[recording software name\] split audio tracks”. If you cannot record with isolated audio tracks for any reason, you can record your clicks separately with another device and submit both files through a Google Drive (or Google Drive-equivalent) folder. Lastly, you can also configure your recording software so that only your microphone audio can be heard in your video. This is only recommended as a last resort for isolating clicks.
