## Uploading

### File download (recommended)

To submit your raw footage, you must upload it in a way that lets us access the raw file. We recommend you use [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/), but any file-sharing platform will work, as long as it allows the list team to easily **download the file**, and **does not change the file** being uploaded in any way. Platforms like YouTube do not meet these requirements, as it will strip the file of all audio tracks except for the first one. Additionally, please ensure the file is accessible to **anyone with the link**, and will not expire after a certain amount of time. 

### VOD

If your completion is recorded through a livestream on YouTube or Twitch, the livestream VOD counts as a form of raw footage, however **note that a downloadable video file is preferred.**

### Discord call

If you cannot upload your raw footage to any file-sharing platform, and your raw footage is not in the form of a VOD, you can also request a list staff member to watch your raw footage from a stream in a Discord call. **This is an absolute last resort that should only be used if you definitely cannot use either of the above methods to submit.** If you do this, please ensure you only play the audio track your clicks are recorded on.
