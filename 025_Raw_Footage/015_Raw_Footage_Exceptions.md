## Exceptions {:raw-footage-exceptions}

* Your record does not need to follow this rule if it has been accepted on Pointercrate. You can read more about records already accepted on Pointercrate [here](#pointercrate-auto-accept). While you submit, you can just paste your public video in the “raw footage” field.
* If your completion is dated before *October 22nd, 2024*, your raw footage does not need to have an isolated audio track with your clicks. Note that you do still need to submit raw footage for your completion.
