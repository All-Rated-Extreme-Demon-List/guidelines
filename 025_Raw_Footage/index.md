# Raw footage {:raw-footage}

If the level you are submitting for is in the top 400, you must submit your raw footage **with your clicks on an isolated audio track** for the list team to review, along with a publicly viewable video. This raw footage file is to be uploaded differently than the public video (which should follow the [Uploading guidelines](#public-video-uploading)).
“Raw footage” refers to the unedited recording of your completion, which should come straight from your recording software. **_You are not allowed to edit this file in any capacity before submitting._**
Raw footage is considered confidential to the list team and will never be shared with anyone outside of it.
