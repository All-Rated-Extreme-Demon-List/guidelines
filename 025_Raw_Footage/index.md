# Raw footage

If the level you are submitting for is in the top 400, you must submit your raw footage **with your clicks on an isolated audio track** for the list team to review, along with a publicly viewable video. This raw footage file is to be uploaded differently than the public video, which should follow the Uploading guidelines [TODO: add link]. “Raw footage” means the unedited recording of your completion, which should come straight from your recording software. You are not allowed to edit this file in any capacity before submitting. Raw footage is considered confidential to the list team and will never be shared with anyone.

## Isolated clicks

Your microphone audio (more specifically, your click sounds) must be on a **separated and isolated audio track** in your raw footage file. This means that one of the audio tracks must record your microphone audio, and **only** your microphone audio. Here are some guides explaining how to configure this with some popular recording softwares:

- [GeForce Experience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP-3dJw0uMY)

If you use a different software, you can try googling “[recording software name] split audio tracks”. If you cannot record with isolated audio tracks for any reason, you can record your clicks separately with another device and submit both files through a Google Drive (or Google Drive-equivalent) folder. Lastly, you can also configure your recording software so that only your microphone audio can be heard in your video. This is only recommended as a last resort for isolating clicks.

## Uploading

### File download (recommended)

To submit your raw footage, you must upload it in a way that lets us access the raw file. We recommend you use [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/), but any file-sharing platform will work, as long as it allows the list team to easily **download the file**, and **does not change the file** being uploaded in any way. Platforms like YouTube do not meet these requirements, as it will strip the file of all audio tracks except for the first one. Additionally, please ensure the file is accessible to **anyone with the link**, and will not expire after a certain amount of time. 

### VOD

If your completion is recorded through a livestream on YouTube or Twitch, the livestream VOD counts as a form of raw footage, however **note that a downloadable video file is preferred.**

### Discord call

If you cannot upload your raw footage to any file-sharing platform, and your raw footage is not in the form of a VOD, you can also request a list staff member to watch your raw footage from a stream in a Discord call. **This is an absolute last resort that should only be used if you definitely cannot use either of the above methods to submit.** If you do this, please ensure you only play the audio track your clicks are recorded on.

## Post-acception

Unlike your public video, you are allowed to delete your raw footage after your record is reviewed. This is done because it is impractical for players to keep their raw footage accessible forever, due to limitations like storage limits.

## Exceptions

- Your record does not need to follow this rule if it has been accepted on Pointercrate. You can read more about records already accepted on Pointercrate here [TODO: add link]. While you submit, you can just paste your public video in the “raw footage” field.
- If your completion is dated before *October 22nd, 2024*, your raw footage does not need to have an isolated audio track with your clicks. Note that you still need to submit raw footage for your completion.
