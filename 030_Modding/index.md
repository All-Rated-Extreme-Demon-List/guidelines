# Modding {:modding}

**Your record may not use any disallowed mods.** A (non-exhaustive) list of what we allow and don't allow can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1M4vXMxHcYwtstB6SD9r4lPFotUXhz3IL9D_3JX8tjyE). This rule also applies to having a red/blue cheat indicator, obvious hacked completions, and bots.
