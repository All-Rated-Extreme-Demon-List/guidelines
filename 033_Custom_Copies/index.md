# Custom copies {:custom-copies}

**If you are using a custom copy of a level (e.g. LDMs, Bugfixes), it must either be approved by list staff before you submit, or not significantly affect the level's gameplay or difficulty without a doubt.** We highly advise you to always approve your custom copies before attempting to use them. However, if you're absolutely certain that your copy is fine, you do not need to get it approved to get your record accepted.

## Pre-approved copies {:pre-approved-copies}
The AREDL website provides pre-approved copies of levels, such as LDMs or Globed 2P copies, for your convenience. All copies found on our website are allowed and do not require approval. You can view a level's pre-approved copies by clicking on the arrow to the right of the "Level ID" text, if any.

## Approval process {:custom-copies-approval}

To get your LDM or bugfix approved, file a ticket on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/aredl) (in #support) with the level ID and a video showcase of the level.

Your copy must not change the gameplay of the level. If you are using an LDM, it must not remove so much detail that it makes the level easier. If you are using a bugfix copy, please make sure you arenâ€™t mistaking an inconsistent part or input in a level with a bug.
Please note that we also do not accept recolorations of existing levels, like [Trans Acu](https://youtu.be/npMlWJsghX8) for example.
