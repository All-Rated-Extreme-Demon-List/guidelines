# Custom copies
**If you are using a custom copy of a level (e.g. LDMs, Bugfixes), it must either be approved by list staff before you submit, or not significantly affect the level's gameplay or difficulty without a doubt.** We highly advise you to always approve your custom copies before attempting to use them. However, if you're absolutely certain that your copy is fine, you do not need to get it approved to get your record accepted.

## Approval process

To get your LDM or bugfix approved, file a ticket on our Discord server (in #support) with the level ID and a video showcase of the level.

Your copy must not change the gameplay of the level. If you are using an LDM, it must not remove so much detail that it makes the level easier. If you are using a bugfix copy, please make sure you arenâ€™t mistaking an inconsistent part or input in a level with a bug.
