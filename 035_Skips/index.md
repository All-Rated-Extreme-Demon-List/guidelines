# Skips
During your completion, you may not use any skips that make any section of the level significantly easier. Skips that barely affect the difficulty or make a section of the level harder are allowed. For more information of what is and isn't allowed, please see [Pointercrate's ruleset for skips](https://pointercrate.com/guidelines/eligibility/#skips). Everything stated in that section of the Pointercrate guidelines is accurate to what we follow here. Please contact a list moderator if you are unsure about a skip you plan on using!
