# Two player
Globed 2P Completions will be allowed on AREDL, however, your video needs to have both POVs, or you need to submit your friend's video in the notes. Globed deathlink is allowed for levels that do not work with Globed's built in 2P mode, but these completions needs to be on an official AREDL Globed copy, which can be found on the "AREDLofficial" Geometry Dash account.
