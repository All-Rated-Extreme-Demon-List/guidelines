# Two player {:two-player}
You are only allowed to use a second player for parts with the Two Player mode in Geometry Dash. Singleplayer parts must be played by one person only.

On the list, almost all two player Extreme demons have 2 placements: one for beating it solo, and one for beating it with another person. If your completion was done with another person, including completions through Globed, select the level suffixed with "(2P)". Otherwise, select the level suffixed with "(Solo)".

If a level does not have a separated 2 Player and Solo listing on our site (this can be because the level's difficulty does not change when playing solo), both solo and 2 player completions are accepted for that level.

## Globed 2P {:online-multiplayer}
Globed 2P Completions are allowed, however, your video needs to have both POVs, or you need to submit your friend's video in the notes. Use of a Deathlink 2 player copy and Globed's deathlink setting is allowed for levels that do not work with Globed's built in 2P mode, but these completions needs to be on an official AREDL Deathlink copy, which can be found on the ["AREDLofficial" Geometry Dash account](https://gdbrowser.com/u/aredlofficial). If the level does not have an official Deathlink copy, you may create or find your own (with each two player portion of the level **retaining the dual physics from normal dual sections**). We recommend you approve this copy the same way you would an LDM or any other custom copy, which you can read more about [here](#custom-copies). Note that we also provide pre-approved Globed 2P copies on our website, which you can find by clicking on the arrow to the right of the "Level ID" text, if any.
