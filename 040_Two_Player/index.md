# Two player {:two-player}

Globed 2P Completions will be allowed on AREDL, however, your video needs to have both POVs, or you need to submit your friend's video in the notes. Use of a Deathlink 2 player copy and Globed's deathlink setting is allowed for levels that do not work with Globed's built in 2P mode, but these completions needs to be on an official AREDL Deathlink copy, which can be found on the ["AREDLofficial" Geometry Dash account](https://gdbrowser.com/u/aredlofficial). If the level does not have an official Deathlink copy, you may create or find your own (with each two player portion of the level **retaining the dual physics from normal dual sections**). We recommend you approve this copy the same way you would an LDM or any other custom copy, which you can read more about [here](#custom-copies).
