# Alt accounts {:alt-accounts}

Submitting records with alternate accounts on the AREDL website is not allowed in any capacity. This includes but is not limited to ban evasion, impersonation, and submitting records for another player. You may only submit **your own records** under your main Discord account. 

If the list team detects that you are submitting records under an alternate account, the alternate account will be deleted and, depending on the severity of the offense, you will either be verbally warned by a staff member or temporarily/permanently banned from the list, and possibly [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/aredl) as well. If you attempt to evade a temporary ban, your ban will be extended or in some cases made permanent.
