These are the markdown files which the [AREDL Guidelines Page](https://aredl.net/guidelines/) is built from. Feel free to open a pull request to suggest any rewordings/errors. 

All headers (`# ` and `## `) should have an ID attached to them, so that they can be linked to. IDs must be unique throughout the entire repository. An ID is denoted by:
`{:id-of-header}`.
