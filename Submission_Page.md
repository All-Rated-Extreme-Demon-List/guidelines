### We **highly** recommend you [read the full guidelines here](/guidelines/), but these are the main things you need to know.

* Your completion video and raw footage must have all clicks fully audible throughout the entire completion.
* You must record and upload a video of your completion to YouTube or another video sharing platform.
* Completion videos may not be deleted after they are accepted.
* If your video was uploaded after July 2nd, 2023, your record must have all cheat indicators visible on the level's end screen.
* Your record must show the stats on the endscreen (attempts, orbs, etc.).
* If your record is in the top 400, you must have raw footage, with isolated clicks, uploaded in a downloadable format (e.g. Google Drive) and submitted along with your public video.
* Your record may not use any disallowed mods.
* If you are using a custom copy of a level, it must either be approved by list staff, or not significantly affect the level's gameplay or difficulty without a doubt.
* During your completion, you may not use any skips that make any section of the level significantly easier.
* Globed 2P Completions are allowed, however, you need to include both POVs in the video or provide a link to watch the other POV, and the completion must be on an approved Globed 2P copy.
